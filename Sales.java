 program description:
 --------------------
  program defines a Sales class for managing sales quantities in various meal categories. It includes constants for
  category prices, constructors for initialization, getters and setters for each category, and methods for adding sales
  and calculating total sales. The toString method provides a formatted string representation, and the equals method
  compares Sales objects for equality.
 ------------------------
 Algorithm of the program
 ------------------------
1)Sales Class:
Define a class named "Sales" to represent sales quantities for different meal categories.
2)Constants:
Include constants representing prices for each meal category:
=>JUNIOR_PRICE, TEEN_PRICE, MEDIUM_PRICE, BIG_PRICE, FAMILY_PRICE.
3)Instance Variables:
Declare instance variables to store sales quantities for each meal category:
=>junior, teen, medium, big, family.
4)Default Constructor:
Create a default constructor initializing sales quantities to default values.
5)Parameterized Constructor:
Implement a parameterized constructor allowing the initialization of sales quantities.
6)Copy Constructor:
Implement a copy constructor creating a new Sales object based on an existing one.
7)Getter and Setter Methods:
Create getter and setter methods for each meal category to retrieve and update sales quantities.
8)Add Sales Method:
Implement a method (addSales) to add sales quantities for each meal category.
9)Sales Total Method:
Implement a method (salesTotal) to calculate the total sales amount based on the quantities and prices.
10)ToString Method Override:
Override the toString() method to provide a formatted string representation of sales quantities.
11)Equals Method:
Implement a method (equals) to check equality between two Sales objects based on sales quantities.
