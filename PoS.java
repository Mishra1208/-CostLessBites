    Program Description:
    --------------------
     program defines a Point of Sale (PoS) class for a sales system with methods to handle sales and prepaid card
     operations. It supports tasks like comparing total sales, managing prepaid cards, updating card expiry,
     adding sales categories, and providing a string representation of the sales breakdown.
-----------------------
Algorithm of the program:
------------------------
1) Class (PoS):
=>Represents a Point of Sale with sales and prepaid cards.
=>Contains private members for storing sales and an array of
prepaid cards.
2)Constructors:
=>Default constructor is present but not provided in the code.
=>Parameterized constructor initializes sales and prepaid cards.
3)Comparison Methods:
=>totalSalesEqual(PoS other): Compares total sales with another PoS object.
=>salesCategoriesEqual(PoS other): Compares sales categories with another PoS object.
4)Sales Information Retrieval:
=>totalSales(): Retrieves the total sales.
=>numPrepaidCards(): Returns the number of prepaid cards.
5)Prepaid Card Operations:
=>addPrepaidCard(PrePaiCard card): Adds a prepaid card to the array.
=>removePrepaidCard(int index): Removes a prepaid card from the array.
=>updatePrepaidCardExpiry(int index, int newDay, int newMonth): Updates the expiry date of a prepaid card.
6)Sales Categories:
=>addSales(int junior, int teen, int medium, int big, int family): Adds sales for different categories.
7)Object Equality:
=>equals(PoS other): Checks if two PoS objects are equal based on total sales and the number of prepaid cards.
8)String Representation:
=>toString(): Generates a string representation of the PoS object, including sales and prepaid card details.
9)Sales Breakdown:
=>salesBreakdown(): Returns the sales breakdown as a string.
